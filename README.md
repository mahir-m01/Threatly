# About Threatly

Small developers, startups, and open-source maintainers often lack accessible tools to evaluate their application’s security posture. Tools like OWASP ZAP or Nuclei are powerful but complex to configure, while dependency vulnerabilities and weak configurations often go unnoticed.  

**Threatly** aims to simplify this process through a full-stack dashboard that integrates multiple free security APIs and tools, allowing users to test their web apps or GitHub repositories and view consolidated reports in one place.
